// Question 1: What is JavaScript, and how does it differ from HTML and CSS?

// JavaScript is a programming language used primarily to create interactive and dynamic content on websites.
// HTML -Defines the structure and content of a webpage. Think of it as the "skeleton" of a webpage, organizing elements like headings, paragraphs, images, and links.
//CSS - Handles the visual presentation of a webpage, including layout, colors, fonts, and spacing. It's like the "skin" and "clothes" of the webpage.
//JavaScript - Adds interactivity and dynamic behavior. It can manipulate HTML and CSS in real time, such as changing styles, updating content, or responding to user input.
